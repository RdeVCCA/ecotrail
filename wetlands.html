                    classified into 4 sections

                <p class = "center">Our freshwater marsh wetland is a shallow area of land that is
                    covered by water and predominantly dotted with emergent plants.

                    species like mudskippers, crabs, water snakes, herons, kingfishers, and sunbirds,
                    and attracts various migratory shorebirds during the migration season.</p>

                <p>Right beside the main wetland, you can find the mangrove section. In collaboration with
                    the Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve, RVHS is proud to showcase the mangrove habitat in our Eco-Trail.

                <p>The muddy waters of coastal wetlands are extremely carbon-rich and mangrove plants help to sequester
                    large amounts of carbon as they grow.</p>
