In 1621, Dutch East India company officials committed genocide against the uncooperative local Bandanese people, and enslaved those who survived, just to remove one obstacle to their monopolistic dreams.

      "info1": "Parts of the plant are also used in Polynesian and Asian traditional medicine. Historically in the Maldives the leaves of this plant were often used as famine food.",
      "info2": "The plant is used for soil stabilization, especially of sand dunes. It makes a good, dense hedge and so is of value to provide protection from the wind and salt spray in coastal zones. It is grown in erosion control schemes in Florida.",
      "info3": "However, the fast growth of the species has out-competed many flora naturally associated with sandy beaches and hence negatively impacts various critically endangered and vulnerable species, such as that in Florida, the Bahamas, and Puerto Rico. Moreover, thickets of S. taccada on sandy beaches may prevent access of sea turtles to nesting areas, which is evidented on islands in the Caribbean region, while in other places, S. taccada trees provide a safe and shady environment for female green turtles coming to shore to lay their eggs.",
