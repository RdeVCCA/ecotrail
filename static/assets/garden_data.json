In 1621, Dutch East India company officials committed genocide against the uncooperative local Bandanese people, and enslaved those who survived, just to remove one obstacle to their monopolistic dreams.

      "info3": "However, the fast growth of the species has out-competed many flora naturally associated with sandy beaches and hence negatively impacts various critically endangered and vulnerable species, such as that in Florida, the Bahamas, and Puerto Rico. Moreover, thickets of S. taccada on sandy beaches may prevent access of sea turtles to nesting areas, which is evidented on islands in the Caribbean region, while in other places, S. taccada trees provide a safe and shady environment for female green turtles coming to shore to lay their eggs.",
