Vital to the body, vitamin C not only improves wound healing, it also improves iron absorption and helps the body’s immune system to function properly. As vitamin C is a water soluble vitamin which is not retained by the body, it relies on a daily intake to maintain healthy levels.",
      "info2": "Guava is low in glycaemic index and glycaemic load, making it a great choice for people with diabetes. Also, because of the high-fibre content, it can help to regulate blood sugar levels by slowing down the release of sugars into the bloodstream. A popular way for Singaporeans to consume the guava fruit is to have it cut raw, sprinkled with plum / prune powder. However, the powder could be high in sugar, diminishing the benefits of intaking guava.",
      "info3": "Guava leaf extract has been shown to have an anticancer effect in recent studies. Test-tube and animal studies show that guava extract can prevent and even stop the growth of cancer cells. This is likely due to the high levels of powerful antioxidants that prevent free radicals from damaging cells, one of the main causes of cancer. Meanwhile, the guava leaves in particular are commonly used in Traditional East Asian Medicine remedies.",
